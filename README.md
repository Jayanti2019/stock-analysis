# Stock-analysis Refactored
## Purpose of the Project
Steve likes the analysis we already did, but want to extend this analysis to more than 12 stocks. We will be using existing code and make some changes, which is called Refactoring. In that process we will see whether we can make the code more efficient, by making changes in logic or taking fewer steps.
